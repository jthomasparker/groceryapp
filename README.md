What is this?

This app is for the price-conscious consumer who clips coupons or drives out of their way to save 2 cents/gallon on gas. The user will simply put in their grocery list, and the app will tell them where each of their items are the lowest price to save the maximum amount of money on groceries, OR if the user prefers to only go to one store, it will tell them what store they will save the most based on the items on their list. The database of products/prices/stores will be populated by the community through the app's easy-to-use receipt scanner- users simply take a picture of their receipts through the app and the app will add that information to the database.
